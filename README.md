# ZX-Image
PHP-based ZX Spectrum images parsing into PNG/GIF. Supports animation, supports file caching.

## Basic usage example
```php
<?php
include_once('ZxImage/Converter.php');

$converter = new \ZxImage\Converter();
$converter->setType('standard');
$converter->setPath('example.scr'); //
$converter->setBorder(5); //cyan
$converter->setZoom(1); //1 for 320*240 (256*192 with border)

//convert and return image data
if ($binary = $converter->getBinary()) {
    //after conversion we can ask for a mime type of last operation and send it to browser
    if ($imageType = $converter->getResultMime()) {
        header('Content-Type: ' . $imageType);
    }

    //send image contents to browser
    echo $binary;
}
```

## File cache setup example
Converting on the fly is slow and resource-demanding, so it's advised to set up built-in file caching.

```php
//ensure that there is a folder for converted images cache
if (!is_dir($folderForCache)) {
	mkdir($folderForCache);
}
//set cache path
$converter->setCachePath($folderForCache);
//enable file cache
$converter->setCacheEnabled(true);
```
After this all images will be stored in folder as a cache. Converter will check and delete outdated images automatically.


## Installation
Installation through Composer:
```json
{
    "require": {
		"moroz1999/zx-image": "*"
    }
}
```
The library is also capable of working without Composer autoloader.
